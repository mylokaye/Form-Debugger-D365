# Form Debugger for Dynamics 365 

A dependency-free Chrome and Microsoft Edge extension for debugging **Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys forms**.

It automatically applies the `#d365mkt-nocache` cache-bypass hash on supported Dynamics asset URLs, identifies the active Form ID, and exposes hidden form fields for submission testing.

## Installation

Install the extension from your browser's store:

- **Chrome Web Store:** [Dynamics 365 Form Debugger](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dynamics-365-form-debugge/kdhnliicfgopcijgepghgohnhafphohf)
- **Microsoft Edge Add-ons:** [Dynamics 365 Form Debugger](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/dynamics-365-form-debugge/ceoaoafhphcpdokfdfkiilmndbepbbec)

For local development:

1. Open `chrome://extensions` or `edge://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Select **Load unpacked**.
4. Choose the repository's `Chrome-Edge/` directory.

## Features

- **Automatic cache bypass** — Adds `#d365mkt-nocache` to supported `assets-*.mkt.dynamics.com` form URLs.
- **Form ID detection** — Displays the detected Dynamics Form ID in the popup and copies it on click.
- **Editable hidden fields** — Renders hidden fields in their original form layout with a green debug border.
- **Complete Dynamics field support** — Handles native hidden inputs and designer-hidden `input`, `select`, and `textarea` controls.
- **Submission testing** — Synchronizes edits to the original source controls and dispatches normal `input` and `change` events.
- **Dynamic form support** — Labels newly inserted hidden fields without creating duplicates.
- **Feature toggle** — Enables or disables the extension's page features, stores that preference locally, and refreshes the active page when possible after a change.
- **Compact popup** — Uses a 400 × 260px layout with the extension logo, feature toggle, cache status, Form ID, installed version, and support link.
- **Consistent diagnostics** — Uses the **Dynamics 365 Form Debugger** console prefix with blue branding and clear black message text.
- **Localized interface** — Supports the ten most-used web content languages through Chrome's native locale system.
- **No runtime dependencies or telemetry** — Uses browser APIs and plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only.

## How It Works

1. Open a supported Dynamics standalone form or a page containing an embedded Dynamics form.
2. The extension detects the form and automatically displays editable copies of its hidden fields.
3. Hidden-field copies use the form's existing styles and a green border so they are easy to distinguish.
4. Editing a displayed copy updates the corresponding original control used by the form submission.
5. On supported Dynamics asset pages, cache bypass is applied automatically while the extension is enabled.
6. Use the popup's **Extension features** toggle to pause or resume cache bypass, form detection, field rendering, and diagnostics. The active page is refreshed when the browser allows it.
7. Open the extension popup to view or copy the Form ID, confirm cache status, view the installed version, or open support.

Reload the extension and refresh existing form tabs after installing a local update so the latest content script is injected.

## Hidden-Field Editing

The rendered controls are debug copies. Their `id`, `name`, `required`, `form`, and list bindings are removed so the copies cannot submit duplicate values.

When you edit a debug copy, the extension updates the original hidden control and dispatches the same `input` or `change` event. If you then submit the form, the website receives the edited value through its normal submission process.

Turning a native `input[type="hidden"]` into a visible debug control affects only the copy; the original input remains hidden.

## Privacy & Data

The extension does not collect, store, or transmit form values, browsing history, credentials, or telemetry.

- Form IDs are read from the current page and shown only in the popup.
- Hidden-field values and edits remain in the current page session.
- Edited values may be transmitted by the host website only when you submit its form.
- The extension stores only the enabled/disabled preference locally through `chrome.storage.local`; it does not persist form data.
- Selecting the popup's information button opens the external [support website](https://mylokaye.info).

## Permissions and Site Access

- **`activeTab`** — Allows the popup to request the detected Form ID from the current tab.
- **`storage`** — Stores the user's enabled/disabled preference locally so the toggle applies across page reloads and browser sessions.
- **`*://*.dynamics.com/*` host access** — Allows the service worker to apply cache bypass on supported Dynamics asset URLs.
- **`<all_urls>` content-script access** — Allows detection when Dynamics forms are embedded on third-party websites. The content script limits field inspection to detected Dynamics form containers.

The extension does not collect or transmit the locally stored preference.

## Supported Languages

The manifest and popup are localized for the ten most-used website content languages reported by [W3Techs on 22 June 2026](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_language):

- English
- Spanish
- German
- Japanese
- French
- Portuguese (Brazil and Portugal)
- Russian
- Italian
- Dutch
- Polish

Chrome selects the closest supported locale from the browser UI language and falls back to English.
Portuguese is packaged as both `pt_BR` and `pt_PT`; the ten languages therefore use eleven locale catalogs.

## Development

The unpacked extension is loaded directly from `Chrome-Edge/`; there is no build step or package manager.

Minimum static validation:

```sh
node -e 'JSON.parse(require("fs").readFileSync("Chrome-Edge/manifest.json", "utf8"))'
node --check Chrome-Edge/config.js
node --check Chrome-Edge/background.js
node --check Chrome-Edge/content-script.js
node --check Chrome-Edge/popup.js
```

Behavior changes should also be tested by loading `Chrome-Edge/` as an unpacked extension and exercising standalone, embedded, dynamically inserted, normal, and restricted pages.
